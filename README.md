# Description

Steppy is a simple mod allowing you to set your step height. I personally find this to be a lot better than the vanilla auto jump feature.

The mod has the following options:

- Enable Steppy: whether the mod should be enabled or disabled. (Default true)
- Enable Steppy when sneaking: if the increase in step height should be applied when sneaking. (Default false)
- Step height: how many blocks the player can step up. (Default 1.25)
